Hey everyone, it’s Dan from [SidehustleReliance.com](https://SidehustleReliance.com), and this is my Freecash Review for 2023. Over the past 12 months, I made above £5,000 using online sites, and applications and being savvy with my spending. One of my highest earners was something called “get paid to” sites (GPT). These are sites where you complete small tasks will that be playing games, completing surveys or even watching videos online. I’ve discussed several sites in the past like [Swagbucks](https://sidehustlereliance.com/swagbucks-ultimate-uk-guide-2023/)and [Lootup.me](https://Lootup.me). But in this video, we are gonna be reviewing a different site known as [Freecash](https://freecash.com/r/76561198042764897)and why you should be using it in 2023 and provide some payment proof.

**What is Freecash? (Review intro)**

Freecash is a very popular GPT site, they have over 1 million users. I have cashed out $28 million to their users as of February 2023. When using the site, they have all the traditional things you’d expect surveys, offer walls, video watching, and much more. When using Freecash, they allowed multiple different cash-out methods, this includes Amazon vouchers, Paypal, and even cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin and Bitcoin.

**Using Freecash in 2023 (Guide and Review)**

Well, that’s all fine and dandy but why should you be using Freecash in 2023? The first thing they offer is the same or higher value tasks than any other side example if you search for GoPuff, Freecash will pay you 37 dollars in value to sign up, whilst Swagbucks pays £33. You may be thinking I’ll just stick with Swagbucks if it’s the same. Well on Freecash the more you earn, the more you can claim as a daily bonus. After you’ve made $100 dollars you can log on daily to claim a free 10 cents every single day forever if you earn atleast 1 dollar per month.

Another thing to know is how well Freecash integrates into phone farming or video-watching sites. So with Freecash, if you use the website, Loot TV, you earn more money than any other site when transferring points over. It is literally a one-to-one ratio so 1 cent on loot TV is 1 cent on Freecash. Always make sure you transfer over as soon as you hit 1000 points on loot tv, this way you can claim a free 2.5 cents extra. Every little helps.

On a Sunday between 3 pm and 5 pm GMT, Freecash will release three bonus codes on their social channels, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, which can be inputted into the site. These codes range from $.20-$.50 depending on what promotions going on. They do go quickly so I will make sure you got your notifications on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. What I’ve noticed is the first called releases on Twitter, then Instagram and Facebook and they do this every single week. It’s ideal really because I find online moneymaking always slows down on a Sunday. A lot of the providers are actually after the weekend to make money online. If you haven’t got some kind of dedicated way to earn.

As a reader of the SidehustleReliance website and on my personal review of Freecash for 2023, you can sign up with the link in my description, to get a free case, when opened this case has the potential to have up to $250 inside. As well as if you earn $1 in the first 48 hours of your account being open, you’ll get three extra cases, which can also reach to $250 each. I’d suggest waiting until you have 1,000 points on Loot TV before signing up, so you can maximise your earnings.

One more thing, Freecash works really well with the data-sharing applications [Honeygain](https://r.honeygain.me/D4F0417641), [Peer2profit](https://peer2profit.com/r/16286843496113c03d404bf) and [earnapp](https://earnapp.com/i/865jewy). Simply install it on your PC or mobile device, and will run passively every day to give you brilliant passive income.

**Conclusion of Freecash Review for 2023**

Following that review, here’s my view on why you should be using Freecash in 2023. It’s got some great perks, and it’s widely accessible. I’m using Freecash for four things, the $.10 a day login bonus, the offer walls, transferring of points from video watching on [loot.tv](https://loot.tv) on your phone, or PC, or when I’m putting the bonus codes. As that’s the case it’s definitely worth signing up.
